## How ROT13 works

    * ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet.
    * The cipher is reversible.
    * The cipher is commonly used to encode text to make it readable by programs that don't understand the language of the author.

## Sample output

```
**ROT13:** Gur zbfg pbzzba pevgvpvfz bs nofheqvfz vf gb nethr gung yvsr va snpg unf zrnavat.
**Reversed:** The most common criticism of absurdism is to argue that life in fact has meaning.
